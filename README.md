-	Purpose of the project:
The type of system will be a stock controlling system that collects stock data, stores stock data, process stock data and delivers an output. All the information of a stock item will be added as the stock item enters the stock facility, the information about the item will then be stored in the system. An employee which is authorised will have the ability to add, view, edit and delete the stock item.
This system will allow the company to have control over their stock in their stock facility, as well as be able to generate reports from the system.

-	Scope of the project:
The system will provide the company with all the necessary information about all the stock items currently stored in the physical stock facility without having to physically search through each item in the stock facility.

Benefits of this system is that the company can have live feed of their stock available in the stock facility. An employee’s questions about whether a stock item is available or not, or details about the stock item can be answered immediately by using the system.

An employee will no longer have to go through the whole stock facility to counting all stock items and collecting information manually. 
The goal of this system is to be able to provide the company with a computerised system that will keep all records of stock.
This system will improve efficiency, accuracy and productivity of the employees working with the stock facility.
The system will also help with the administration of how many items are still available.
